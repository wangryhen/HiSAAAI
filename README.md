## 🔍 Overview

Given an input speech signal, **HiSTalk** generates lifelike 3D talking-head animations by combining:

1. **Coarse Motion Generator (CMG)**: captures global facial trajectories from multi-scale speech embeddings via a lightweight Transformer.
2. **Fine Motion Refiner (FMR)**:

   * **HSF2S** (Hierarchical Speech Features → Sparse landmarks): encodes frame-, phoneme-, word-, and utterance-level cues into weighted sparse landmark displacements using a squeeze-and-excitation gating mechanism.
   * **S2D** (Sparse → Dense): lifts weighted sparse offsets into full-face 3D deformation fields with multi-branch attention-fusion Transformer decoders.

By fusing macro-level guidance with fine-grained refinements, HiSTalk achieves precise lip-sync and rich expressiveness on VOCASET and BIWI benchmarks.
