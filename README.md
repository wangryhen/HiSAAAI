Given a speech signal as input, our framework <strong>HiSTalk</strong> can generate realistic 3D talking heads through the Hierarchical Speech Features to Sparse Landmarks <strong>(HSF2S)</strong> module and the Sparse Landmarks to Dense Landmarks Displacements <strong>(S2D)</strong> module.

## TODO
- [x] **Release Arxiv paper.**
- [x] **Release Project Page.**
- [ ] **Release code. (Once the paper is accepted)**
- [ ] **Release Pre-trained Model. (Once the paper is accepted)**
